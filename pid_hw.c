 * Revisions:
 *  Kevin Peterson      2012-04-05    Initial release
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - !!!!!!! PID gains must be between -1 and 1 !!!!!!!
 *  - This file is a wrapper for the built in dsp PID controller on the dsPIC
 *  - The memory model in the build options must be set to Large Data Model for
 *    this code to properly compile. Also, under "Project Properties/XC16
 *    (Global Options)/xc16-ld", add -ldsp-elf in the "Additional options" field
