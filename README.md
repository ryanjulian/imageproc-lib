Note: Please remember to also set up an integration branch in the [octoroach](https://github.com/ryanjulian/octoroach/tree/imageproc2.5-integration)
repository. Unit tests will be pulled into octoroach while library updates
will be pulled into here.

This is the board support integration branch for imageproc-lib on the
ImageProc 2.5. Please send pull requests with ImageProc 2.5-related changes
to this branch.

Use the following commands to setup the integration branch in your local git 
repository. These commands assume you have forked imageproc-lib from 
biomimetics into your Github account, and then cloned your Github fork into
your local repository.

After following these instructions, "push" will always push changes to your
fork of the integration branch on your Github account, while "pull" will
always pull the most recent changes from the central integration branch.

In Git Bash:
```bash
git remote add -t imageproc2.5-integration imageproc2.5-integration git@github.com:ryanjulian/imageproc-lib.git
git fetch imageproc2.5-integration
git checkout -b imageproc2.5-integration -t imageproc2.5-integration/imageproc2.5-integration
git push origin imageproc2.5-integration
git remote set-url --push imageproc2.5-integration `git config remote.origin.url`
```

Shared library for ImageProc projects
=====================================

Description
-----------
A set of common modules developed for the ImageProc family of boards,
which use Microchip's dsPIC architecture.

Download code
-------------
https://github.com/biomimetics/imageproc-lib

Usage
-----
Place this library under the embedded source directory where your
ImageProc project resides (e.g. embedded/imageproc-lib/ if your project
is in embedded/project/), then modify your project so that it knows
where to find the library, and finally compile.
